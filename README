JavascriptAutoInclude
=====================

== Resources

Install
 * Run the following command:
 script/plugin install http://kernowsoul.com/svn/plugins/javascript_auto_include
 
== Usage

 Add the following to the head of your template file

 <%= javascript_auto_include_tags %>
 
 Now each time the template is loaded javascript files in the public/javascripts/views
 folder that correspond to the name of the current controller or view will be auto
 loaded. For example:

 /public
   /javascripts
     /views
       users.js
       /users
         edit.js
       roles.js
       /accounts
         show.js

 Assuming the above file structure loading each of the following urls would load:
 
 mydomain.com/users             # loads users.js
 mydomain.com/users/edit/1      # loads users.js and edit.js
 mydomain.com/users/show/1      # loads users.js
 mydomain.com/roles             # loads roles.js
 mydomain.com/accounts          # no js files loaded
 mydomain.com/accounts/show/1   # loads show.js
